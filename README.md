  This a simulation that allows the user to interact with a normal cell with the aim to disturb its gene expression. Our simulation addresses the question: What does it take for a cell become a cancer? In this simulation, for demo purposes, we decided to focus on the p53 gene, once thought to code for oncogenes. The p53 gene is the tumor supressor gene, located in the 17th chromosome of the human genome. If the gene experiences base pair mutations, then the cell runs the risk of becoming malignant as a result of suppressed gene expression.

  There are many ways that the trillions of cells populating your person can become malignant and dangerous. This simulation highlights a few of the multitudinous ways your cells can become cancer cells. Specifically in this program, single base pair mutations in the chromosomal DNA located in the nucleus, can be controlled by the user, allowing them to see how a seemingly insignificant change in the genetic make-up of an organism, which can seriously affect how certain proccesses are carried out (or if they aren't carried out at all).

  The user is presented with a series of variables to affect the normal cell in its environment in order to convert it into a cancer cell. With a series of fun animations and interesting tinkering capabilities, people of all ages can see how genomics can play a role into the creation of cancer cells. Perhaps, using this simulation to further understand how cancer comes into being, we can raise more awareness for something a lot of people around the world must live with on a daily basis. For understanding arbitrarity will we ever be able come up with answers.
